#Here I used the random module to create the list1 and iterated over list and put the lowest value members 
#into a new list list2 and removed them out of the old list list1. rinse and repeat until old list is empty.

#'timeit' module can be used to find out how long each takes...
#It takes 0.01133229999999985 for above example

# Space:
#----------

# memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input

# Time Complexity - Linear Time â€” O(n)
#-------------------------------------

# An algorithm is said to have a linear time complexity when the running time increases at most 
# linearly with the size of the input data. This is the best possible time complexity when the algorithm must 
# examine all values in the input data
